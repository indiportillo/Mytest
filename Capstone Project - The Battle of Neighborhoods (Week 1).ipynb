    "##### Description of the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We will develop a program to help solve the problem of people seeking to relocate to King Couny, Washington. Let's think abount a consumer that wants to relocate to King County; for that purpose he will use some variables to make their decision better. For example, he will need to know the price of the new house as his rent is limited and maybe some other features like the sqrt $m² or if the house has terrace or not, however, to make the things easier we will use only the price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although price is a very important variable, it is not the only one. For example, if the consumer is a family head, some other variables like the nearby will be important or the crime rate of that city. Those features can be obtained with the foursquare API\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we are going to carry out a program that helps consumers to solve what in Microeconomics is called \"the consumer's problem\", that is, consumers will try to maximize their utility taking into account a limited budget\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "For that purpose we are going to use 2 datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first dataset is a dataset we know because we used it in some exercises of this course, it is the House Sales in King County dataset used in the \"Data Analysis with python\" Course: https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DA0101EN/coursera/project/kc_house_data_NaN.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And the second dataset is the following one https://data.kingcounty.gov/Law-Enforcement-Safety/King-County-Sheriff-s-Office-Incident-Dataset/rzfs-wyvy . Here we can obtain the incidents recorded by King County Sheriff's Department, broken down by the incident datetime, adress and so on.\n",
